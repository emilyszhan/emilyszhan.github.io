 👩🏻‍💻 I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Information and Media PhD program at Michigan State University's College of Communication Arts and Sciences. I study the **psychological processes** of AI agents and AI-mediated messages in terms of **how people understand AI socially**. My research informs how to communicate about using AI (e.g., interface design, accessibility cues) to designers and social entities that deploy AI (e.g., companies and governments). A broader scope of my study contexts encompasses social media user behavior, crisis communication, civic participation, digital application design, and gender-focused advertising content. My research adopts a diverse range of methodologies, such as experiments, surveys, computational, and mixed-method approaches. 

# 🔥 I am on the job market this academic year!
I am looking for a tenure-track assistant professor position in emerging media and technology, AI-human communication, strategic communication, media psychology, etc.
