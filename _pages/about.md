 I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information and Media PhD program at College of Communication Arts and Sciences, Michigan State University. 
 
 I study the **psychological processes** of AI agents and AI-mediated messages in terms of **how people understand AI socially**. 
 
 My research informs the effects of AI use and, more importantly, how to communicate about using AI to designers and social entities that deploy AI (e.g., companies and governments). 
 
 A broader scope of her study contexts encompasses social media user behavior, crisis communication, civic participation, digital application design, and gender-focused advertising content. 
 
 My research adopts a diverse range of methodology, such as experiments, surveys, computational, and mixed-method approaches. 

#💼 I am on the job market this academic year!
I have looking for tenure-track assistant professor position in emerging media & technology, AI-human communication, strategic communication, media psychology.
